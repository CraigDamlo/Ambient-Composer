## What It Does

Ambient Composer generates a complete harmonic foundation — chords with intelligent voice leading, a synchronized bass line, and in-browser audio preview. Everything runs in the browser with no installs or sign-ups.

**Chord Progressions**
- Choose a key, mode (Major / Minor / Dorian), and progression length
- Voicing modes: Fixed, Varied, or Random — from triads up to 11th chords
- Smart Inversions minimize voice movement between chords and across the loop boundary
- Loop quality score shows how smoothly the progression wraps

**Bass Line**
- Five styles: Root Only, Root + Fifth, Walking, Arpeggiated, Pedal Point
- Configurable octave, density, syncopation, rests, and octave jumps
- Regenerates automatically whenever the chord progression changes

**Timeline View**
- Combined piano-roll-style visualization showing chords (purple) and bass (blue) on a single responsive canvas
- Each note displays as a duration bar so you can see exactly how long it's held
- Hover over any note for details — chord name, voice, voicing type, inversion, and beat duration
- Fully scales to your browser window — no scrolling required

**Playback**
- In-browser audio preview using sine wave oscillators with reverb
- Full ADSR envelope controls (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) for the chord layer
- **Sustain Repeated Notes** — when a pitch carries over between chords, it holds as one continuous tone rather than restarting (on by default)
- BPM slider (20–120, default 60) with optional looping
- A playhead cursor sweeps across the timeline in sync with playback

**Export**
- **Copy to Clipboard** — full text export with chord names, voicings, inversions, note names, beat durations, and the complete bass line
- **Download MIDI** — standard Type-1 MIDI file with two tracks (Chords + Bass), ready to drop into any DAW or hardware sequencer
